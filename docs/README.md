      // The default is a single request with an empty predicate to query all documents.
      //
      // Example:
      // queryPredicates: Predicates => ([
      //   Predicates.at(document.tags, ['foo']),
      //   Predicates.at(document.type, 'bar')
      // ]),
      //
      queryPredicates: (Predicates) => ([
        []
      ])
    },
  },
]
```

## Providing JSON schemas

In order for Gatsby to know about your Prismic custom types, you must provide
the full JSON schema of each custom type. This is done via the plugin's
`schemas` option in `gatsby-config.js`.

The recommended approach is to create a `schemas` directory in your project and
import them into your `gatsby-config.js` file.

```js
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-source-prismic',
    options: {
      // ...
      schemas: {
        page: require('./src/schemas/page.json'),
        blog_post: require('./src/schemas/blog_post.json'),
      },
      // ...
    },
  },
]
```

Each schema file should be populated with the contents of the "JSON editor" tab
in the Prismic Custom Type editor.

See the official docs for more details on version controlling your custom types:
[How to version custom types][prismic-version-custom-types].

## How to query

You can query nodes created from Prismic using GraphQL like the following:

**Note**: Learn to use the GraphQL tool and Ctrl+Spacebar at
<http://localhost:8000/___graphql> to discover the types and properties of your
GraphQL model.

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        uid
        first_publication_date
        last_publication_date
        data {
          title {
            text
          }
          content {
            html
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All documents are pulled from your repository and created as
`prismic${contentTypeName}` and `allPrismic${contentTypeName}`, where
`${contentTypeName}` is the API ID of your document's content type.

For example, if you have `Product` as one of your content types, you will be
able to query it like the following:

```graphql
{
  allPrismicProduct {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        data {
          name
          price
          description {
            html
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query Rich Text fields

Data from fields with rich text formatting (e.g. headings, bold, italic) is
transformed to provide HTML and text versions. This uses the official
[prismic-dom][prismic-dom] library and the `linkResolver` and `htmlSerializer`
functions from your site's `gatsby-node.js` to create the HTML and text fields.

**Note**: If you need to access the raw data, the original data is accessible
using the `raw` field, though use of this field is discouraged.

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        data {
          title {
            text
          }
          content {
            html
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query Link fields

Link fields are processed using the official [prismic-dom][prismic-dom] library
and the `linkResolver` function from your site's `gatsby-node.js`. The resolved
URL is provided at the `url` field.

If the link type is a web link (i.e. a URL external from your site), the URL is
provided without additional processing.

All other URL fields, such as `target`, `lang`, and `isBroken`, are provided on
the field, as well.

The `target` field defaults to an empty string. This allows you to always query
the `target` field even if it is not set in Prismic.

**Note**: If you need to access the raw data, the original data is accessible
using the `raw` field, though use of this field is discouraged.

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        data {
          featured_post {
            url
            target
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query Content Relation fields

Content Relation fields relate a field to another document. Since fields from
within the related document is often needed, the document data is provided at
the `document` field. The resolved URL to the document using the official
[prismic-dom][prismic-dom] library and the `linkResolver` function from your
site's `gatsby-node.js` is also provided at the `url` field.

Querying data on the `document` field is handled the same as querying slices.
Please read the [Query slices](#query-slices) section for details.

**Note**: If you need to access the raw data, the original data is accessible
using the `raw` field, though use of this field is discouraged.

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        data {
          featured_post {
            url
            document {
              __typename
              ... on PrismicPost {
                data {
                  title {
                    text
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query slices

Prismic slices allow you to build a flexible series of content blocks. Since the
content structure is dynamic, querying the content is handled differently than
other fields.

To access slice fields, you need to use GraphQL [inline
fragments][graphql-inline-fragments]. This requires you to know types of nodes.
The easiest way to get the type of nodes is to use the `/___graphql` debugger
and run the below query (adjust the document type and field name).

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        data {
          body {
            __typename
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When you have node type names, you can use them to create inline fragments.

Full example:

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        data {
          body {
            __typename
            ... on PrismicPageBodyRichText {
              text {
                html
              }
            }
            ... on PrismicPageBodyQuote {
              quote {
                html
              }
              credit {
                text
              }
            }
            ... on PrismicPageBodyFootnote {
              content {
                html
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query direct API data as a fallback

If you find you cannot query the data you need through the GraphQL interface,
you can get the raw response from the [prismic-javascript][prismic-javascript]
API using the `dataString` field.

This field contains the whole node's original data before processing as a string
generated using `JSON.stringify`.

This is absolutely discouraged as it defeats the purpose of Gatsby's GraphQL
data interface, but it is available if necessary

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        dataString
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Image processing

To use image processing you need `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
`gatsby-plugin-sharp`, and their dependencies `gatsby-image` and
`gatsby-source-filesystem` in your `gatsby-config.js`.

You can apply image processing to any image field on a document. Image
processing of inline images added to Rich Text fields is currently not
supported.

To access image processing in your queries, you need to use this pattern, where
`...ImageFragment` is one of the [`gatsby-transformer-sharp`
fragments][gatsby-image-fragments]:

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        data {
          imageFieldName {
            localFile {
              childImageSharp {
                ...ImageFragment
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Full example:

```graphql
{
  allPrismicPage {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        data {
          imageFieldName {
            localFile {
              childImageSharp {
                resolutions(width: 500, height: 300) {
                  ...GatsbyImageSharpResolutions_withWebp
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

[gatsby-plugin-sharp][gatsby-plugin-sharp].

## Previews

### usePrismicPreview()

`usePrismicPreview()` is a React hook that allows for querying and normalizing
responses from Prismic's API. An example is shown below:

```jsx
import { usePrismicPreview } from 'gatsby-source-prismic'

const PreviewPage = ({ location }) => {
  const { previewData } = usePrismicPreview(location, {
    linkResolver: doc => doc.uid,
    htmlSerializer: () => {},
  })

  return previewData ? (
    <PageTemplate data={previewData} />
  ) : (
    <div>Loading...</div>
  )
}
```

#### Return Value

Returns an object with the following keys:

- `previewData`: An object with the same data shape that `gatsby-source-prismic`
  generates at build time. As such, it can be provided to templates & pages
  directly.
- `path`: A string of the resolved path for the previewed Prismic doc. This is
  determined via the provided `linkResolver` function _or_ an optional
  `pathResolver` function.
- `isInvalid`: A boolean that indicates that a bad token or document ID was
  resolved from `location`. Typically only true if a client manually navigates
  to a preview resolver page.

#### API

`usePrismicPreview` Accepts the following parameters:

- `location`: **Required**. The location object from `@reach/router`. This is
  used to read the preview token and the previewed document's ID to send an API
  request for preview data.
- `overrides`: An object that allows for preview specific overrides of
  `gatsby-source-prismic` config options:
  - `linkResolver`: **Required**. Determines how links in your preview content
    are resolved to URLs. If `pathResolver` is not defined, `linkResolver` is
    used to determine the `path` return value.
  - `htmlSerializer`: **Required**. Function that maps rich text fields to HTML.
    Should be the same function provided to the plugin configuration.
  - `fetchLinks`: Allows you to specify the link fields to fetch for the
    previewed document.
  - `repositoryName`: Your Prismic repository name if it's different from the
    one in `gatsby-config.js`
  - `accessToken`: Your prismic access token if it's different from the one in
    `gatsby-config.js`

> ⚠️ Since preview API requests are made in the browser, your access token will
> be exposed to the client.

#### Gotchas

##### Images

Since data normalization happens at runtime, we cannot perform the same image
optimizations that we do at buildtime. Instead, `usePrismicPreview()` returns
the `url` field for an image.

> ⚛️ A smart image component that conditionally uses `url` or `gatsby-image`
> data is recommended for preview parity.

### mergePrismicPreviewData()

A helper function for merging data from Gatsby's graphQL schema and normalized
responses from `usePrismicPreview`. An example is shown below:

```jsx
import { mergePrismicPreviewData } from 'gatsby-source-prismic'

export const PageTemplate = ({ data }) => {
  // { ... } previewData comes from usePrismicPreview()
  const mergedData = mergePrismicPreviewData({ staticData: data, previewData })

  return <Layout>{/* Do stuff with mergedData */}</Layout>
}
```

`mergePrismicPreviewData` is useful when your previewed templates or pages need
to use data from Prismic that arent't directly provided by the previewed
document. An example of this is if a previewed document's template or page also
uses data from `allPrismicX` queries.

`mergePrismicPreviewData` allows us to show fresh preview data where applicable
for the previewed document on a template, but also fallback to static data from
Gatsby.

#### Return Value

Returns a new object by deeply merging the key-value pairs from `staticData` and
`previewData`. If a key between the two objects are shared, values from
`previewData` are used.

##### If the custom type of the previewed document and the template are different

Returns a new object by deeply traversing `staticData` and replacing any
document links with the previewed document's ID with `previewData`. This is
useful for previewing documents whose data would only be shown on a page via
`allPrismicX` queries.

#### API

Accepts the following parameters via an object:

- `staticData`. **Required**. Static data from a page's GraphQL query. If
  `staticData` is falsey, `mergePrismicPreviewData` will return `undefined`.
- `previewData`. Preview data from `usePrismicPreview()`. If `previewData` is
  falsey, `mergePrismicPreview` will return `staticData` as is.

### In-depth Guide

When creating `gatsby-source-prismic`'s preview API, we wanted to allow
developers to reuse as much of their existing templates and components as much
as possible.

In an ideal scenario, these functions and hooks should provide "drop-in" preview
functionality to most sites using `gatsby-source-prismic` without needing to
specifically configure components to support it.

That being said, there are some recommended guidelines like creating a preview
resolver page, handling preview redirect logic, and handling previewed images.

For an in-depth guide on using previews with `gatsby-source-prismic`, please
refer to [this guide](./previews.md).

## Site's `gatsby-node.js` example

```jsx
const path = require('path')

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { createPage } = actions

  const pages = await graphql(`
    {
      allPrismicPage {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            uid
            template
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  const pageTemplates = {
    Light: path.resolve('./src/templates/light.js'),
    Dark: path.resolve('./src/templates/dark.js'),
  }

  pages.data.allPrismicPage.edges.forEach(edge => {
    createPage({
      path: `/${edge.node.uid}`,
      component: pageTemplates[edge.node.template],
      context: {
        id: edge.node.id,
      },
    })
  })
}
```
